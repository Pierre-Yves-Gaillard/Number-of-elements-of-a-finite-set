We define the number of elements of a finite set.

I believe that Dedekind was the first person to define the number of elements in a finite set. See **Essays on the Theory of Numbers** at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21016), Section 161 p. 56. (Original title: **Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?** Published in 1888.)

It is also defined on p. 53 of Halmos's [**Naive Set Theory**](http://people.whitman.edu/~guichard/260/halmos__naive_set_theory.pdf) (1960).
