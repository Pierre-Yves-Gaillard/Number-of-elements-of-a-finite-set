We define the number of elements of a finite set.

I believe that Dedekind was the first person to define the number of elements in a finite set. See **Essays on the Theory of Numbers** at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21016), Section 161 p. 56. It is also defined on p. 58 of Halmos's **Naive Set Theory**.
